# Flat docs

A collection of documentations of tools used in broad Python stack development
as single HTML files.

I prefer browsing documentation as one file. This helps me with full text
search, regex grepping and content discovery. I am also frustrated by the
quality and variety of various search engines used on documentation websites.
I respect the effort put into these and need not to compete with them. This
should be an alternative.

The repository will contain various format translation scripts, tools to clean,
unify and minimize the content. I will put some effort into visual
standarization but don't want to focus on that.

I plan to add technologies and their versions as I use them and invite others
to contribute.

I will start with these three and work for some time on polishing before moving
on:
- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- Python itself

in their newest versions. The resulting files will be published under
https://flatdocs.brak.me and https://github.com/grupabrak/flatdocs.

Each file will receive a Google Analytics tracking ID so that I can monitor the
usage.

Feature and functionality set:

- [ ] plain text format for terminal interaction
- [ ] statistics overview: word count, byte length, versions covered,
      completeness of the effort
- [ ] automated build and checking for being up to date.
- [ ] cool but absolutley minimalist web front UI

Please share feedback, discuss and propose features. Do you have similar needs
as I do?
